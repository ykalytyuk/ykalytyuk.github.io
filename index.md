# **Yefim Kalytyuk**

Hello my name is Yefim Kalytyuk, and I graduated from Cortland Junior Senior High School. 
Currently, I am going to RIT for Software Engineering and it's a lot of fun (when the code works as planned).
I enjoy playing video games a lot, I would say I spend most of my free time playing video games.
I also play tennis, and I was on the varsity tennis team when I was in high school.

My favorite food is my borscht, which is a beet soup you typically put sour cream on (Shown below)

Here is a link to the RIT SE website, for all your software engineering needs!

Some things I would like to learn from SWEN SE are:
* How to plan every step of the way before writing code
* How to bounce back from failure
* How to work with a client (ie. deciding on features)
